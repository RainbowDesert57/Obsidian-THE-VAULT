# Introduction
- **some organisms use simple food materials obtained from inorganic sources in the form of CO_2 and water. These are know as autotrophs**
- **The carbon and energy requirements are fulfilled by photosynthesis**
---
<span class="subGradientHeading" style="margin: 0;">Photo Synthesis</span>
- **Material is taken in the form of Carbon Dioxide and Water and is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll**
- **Carbohydrates are used for providing energy to the plant**
- **Carbohydrates are not used immediately in plants, they are instead** <span style="background-color: rgba(100, 100, 255, 0.25); border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; padding: 1.5px; padding-right: 7px; padding-left: 7px;">stored in the form of starch</span>

- **Absorption of light energy**
- **conversion of light energy into chemical energy and splitting of water into Hydrogen and Oxygen**
- **Reduction of Carbon Dioxide into Carbohydrates**
### Points to remember
- **This may not take place at the same time of the day**
	- **In desert plants, they take in Carbon Dioxide to make an intermediate form in the night**
	- **This is acted upon by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day**
	- **Why? To minimize loss of water by not opening the pores during the daytime**
- **leaf contain chloroplast which contain chlorophyll**

- **Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus, iron and magnesium**
