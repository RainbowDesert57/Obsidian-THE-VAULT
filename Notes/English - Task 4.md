### üìù Tips for Drawing:

- Keep bird expressions simple and clear (big eyes for fear, smiling beak for joy).
    
- Use speech bubbles for character dialogue and thought bubbles for internal fear/conflict.
    
- Use colored pencils or digital tools to add sky, cliff, and ocean.
    
- Make each panel the same size for neatness or vary size for drama (e.g., make ‚ÄúThe Leap‚Äù a larger panel)
