## We need to balance equations to not break the law of conservation of mass that states
<div class="curvedLeftBorder" style="border-color: #6e40f7;"><span style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 5px;">The law of conservation of mass:
</span>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 5px;">This law states that mass can neither be created nor be destroyed, therefore, the number of atoms on each side (LHS & RHS) should be the same.</div></div>

## Example:
$$Fe + H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + H₂$$
### Method
#### Start with the biggest compund $$Fe_3O_4$$
##### now take the left most element $$Fe_3$$
##### Compare
there is one Fe on LHS and 3 on the RHS
means we need to multiply Fe on LHS by three, this makes it $$3Fe$$
##### the new equation is now $$3Fe+H_2O → Fe_3O_4+H_2$$
now, Fe is balanced, next element in the compound is $$O_4$$
##### by repeating the same, we can find the answer
$$4H_2O$$
now, the compound is balanced
####  now we can move to the next unbalanced element, H
there are 8 on the LHS and 2 on the RHS, so we need to multiply the RHS's H by 4 (4x2=8)
#### this now makes the full equation $$3Fe + 4H_2O → Fe_3O4 + 4H_2$$
