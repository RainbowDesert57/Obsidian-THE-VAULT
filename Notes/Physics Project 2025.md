## ðŸ“˜ CASE 1: Object **between C and F**, slightly **above axis**

### âœ… Ray paths:

1. **Ray 1**: From top of object â†’ parallel to principal axis â†’ reflects through **F**
    
2. **Ray 2**: From top of object â†’ through **C** â†’ reflects back on same path
    
3. **(Optional)** Ray 3: From top of object â†’ through **P** (pole) â†’ follows law of reflection
### âœ… Image:

- Formed **beyond C**
    
- **Real, inverted, magnified**
    
- Slightly **below** axis

## ðŸ“˜ CASE 2: Object **beyond C**, slightly **above axis**

### âœ… Ray paths:

1. **Ray 1**: From top of object â†’ parallel to axis â†’ reflects through **F**
    
2. **Ray 2**: From top of object â†’ through **F** â†’ reflects parallel
    
3. Optional Ray: through **C**, reflects on itself
### âœ… Image:

- Formed **between F and C**
    
- **Real, inverted, diminished**
    
- Slightly **below** axis (because object was above)

## ðŸ“˜ CASE 3: Object **beyond C**, slightly **below axis**

### âœ… Ray paths:

Same rays as CASE 2:

1. Parallel â†’ through **F**
    
2. Through **F** â†’ reflects parallel

### âœ… Image:

- Still **between F and C**
    
- Still **real, inverted, diminished**
    
- But since object was **below**, image forms **above** axis
##### Yes â€” **CBSE twist**: same mirror, same object distance, but because you placed the object below the axis, the image flips **above** axis (still technically _inverted_).
