## Task:
>Create an artistic cover design for a novel that has left a strong impression on
you.
Accompany your illustration with a short write-up (maximum 100 words) explaining your
reason for choosing the novel and how it influenced or inspired you.
## **Title of the Chosen Novel: _The Diary of a Young Girl_ by Anne Frank**

### **Cover Design Concept (for your drawing):**

- A soft sepia-toned background resembling **old paper** or **worn diary pages**
- A **fountain pen** and an **open diary** on the table
- Behind the diary, a faint window outline with the **Star of David** drawn on the glass
- The title in a **handwritten font** at the top
- The author’s name at the bottom in small caps
- Add faint lines of cursive writing in the background to suggest handwritten thoughts

### **Write-Up:**

>I chose _"The Diary of a Young Girl"_ by Anne Frank because it gave me a deeply personal insight into how war affects ordinary lives. Her words, written in hiding, still speak across time and borders. The book inspired me to value peace, resilience, and the freedom of expression. It reminded me how powerful print culture can be — giving a voice to someone who might have been forgotten. Her diary is more than a book; it’s a memory, a legacy, and a mirror to the world’s conscience.
