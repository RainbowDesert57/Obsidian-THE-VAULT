<div class="purpleHighlight h2" style="">The Mouth</div>

- **We need to digest food with small particle size and similar texture. This is achieved by our mouth**
- **Since the canal is soft, food is also wetted to make the passage smooth**
- **Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that breaks down starch that breaks down starch, a complex molecule, into simple sugar**
- **The food is then moved around by then tongue and then pushed into the alimentary canal**
---
<span class="purpleHighlight h2">The Alimentary Canal</span>
- **The food is passed down to the stomach using rhythmic contraction and relaxation of muscles. These paristaltic movement occur all around the gut**
- **Paristalsis:** The rhythmic contraction and relaxation of muscles to transport food
- **This food then enters the stomach**

- The stomach is a large organ which expands when food enters it
- The **muscular walls** in stomach help in mixing the food with more digestive juices
- The digestion is taken care of by the gastric glands

- It is present in the **walls of the stomach**
- It releases **hydrochloric acid**, a **protein digesting enzyme called pepsin**, and **mucus**

- Hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium
- This helps in the reaction of pepsin
- The mucus protects the inner lining of the stomach
### Exit from stomach
- The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a **sphincter muscle** which releases it in small amounts
- **The food now enter the small intestine**

- It is the longest alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of **excessive coiling**
- The length differs in various animals
	- In herbivores it is longer because they have to digest cellulose
	- In carnivores, the intestine is shorter because meat is easier to digest
- This is the site of **complete digestion** of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
- It receives secretions of the liver and pancreas
- The **Bile juice** from pancreas makes the acidic food from the stomach **alkaline**
- The **Bile juice** also acts on the fats in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act.	
- Bile salts make them smaller globules increasing the efficiency of the enzyme reaction
>bile juice makes the acidic food from the stomach an alkaline
>It also breaks down the fats present as large globules to make them small, making it easier for enzymes to act on themrgba(100, 100, 255, 0.25)
- The pancreas secretes pancreatic enzymes like **trypsin for digesting proteins** and **lipase for breaking down <span style="background-color: rgba(100, 10, 255, 0.25); border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; padding: 1.5px; padding-right: 7px; padding-left: 7px;">emulsified</span> fats**

- The walls of small intestine contain intestinal glands that secrete intestinal juice
- The enzymes present in it finally convert the <span style="background-color: rgba(100, 10, 255, 0.25); border-radius: 5px; font-weight: bold; padding: 1.5px; padding-right: 7px; padding-left: 7px;">proteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats into fatty acids and glyceroil</span>

- The digested food is taken up by the walls of intestine.
- The inner lining has numerous finger-like projection called villi which increase the surface area for absorption
	- They are richly supplied with blood vessels where it is utilized for obtaining energy, building up new tissues and the repair of old tissues

- The unabsorbed food is sent to **large intestine**

- Here, its walls absorb more water from food. The rest of the waste material is removed via the anus
- The excretion of this waste material is regulated by the anal sphincter
