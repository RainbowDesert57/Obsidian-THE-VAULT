## **Interviewer**: Good afternoon, Dr. Herriot. Thank you for joining us today. To begin with, what was your first reaction when you saw Tricki?

**Dr. Herriot**: Good afternoon! Honestly, I was stunned. He didn’t look like a dog — more like a bloated submarine waddling in fur, an overfed torpedo on paws. I knew right away that his life was in danger if we didn’t act quickly.

## Explaination if needed
<div style = "border-left: 4px solid #007acc; padding-left: 1rem; border-radius: 7px;">"A torpedo is a long, narrow underwater weapon launched from a submarine or ship. It moves fast and is designed to hit and damage enemy vessels. I just used it as a funny exaggeration — like, Tricki was so round and slow, he looked like a torpedo stuck in reverse."</div>

## **Interviewer**: How did you decide on the treatment plan for Tricki?

**Dr. Herriot**: Honestly, I felt the best medicine for Tricki was a break from indulgence. I didn’t give him any medical treatment. Instead, I put him on a strict diet and allowed him to interact with the other dogs at the surgery. It was about restoring balance — both physically and emotionally... and making him look less like a stuffed marshmellow.

## **Interviewer**: Did you face any challenges during Tricki’s stay at the surgery?

**Dr. Herriot**: At first, he was slow and withdrawn. He had become used to pampering and rich food. But soon, he began responding positively — running around, playing, and even fighting for his food like a proper dog. It was rewarding to see such a transformation.

## **Interviewer**: What role do you think Mrs. Pumphrey played in Tricki’s condition?

**Dr. Herriot**: Mrs. Pumphrey loved Tricki deeply — there’s no doubt about that. But sometimes, too much love can harm. Her constant pampering, overfeeding, and luxury treats did more damage than good. It’s a reminder that discipline is also a form of love.

## **Interviewer**: Looking back, what did you learn from this experience?

**Dr. Herriot**: It reinforced the idea that simple care, proper diet, and natural interaction often work better than medicine. Animals, like humans, need balance. And sometimes, the real triumph in surgery is knowing when **not** to use the scalpel.
