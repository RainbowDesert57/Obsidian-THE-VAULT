# Table: Changes Over Time

|**Aspect**|**Grandparents (30s)**|**Parents (30s)**|**Current Situation**|**Why is this happening?**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Rural**|||||
|Number of cattle/poultry|8 cows, 10 hens|2 cows|0|Shift to urban jobs, less land for livestock|
|Number of trees/ponds|Many trees, 3 ponds|Few trees, 1 pond|Barely any|Urbanization, construction|
|Main occupation (head of family)|Farming|Teaching|IT/Private Job|Education and better job opportunities|
|**Urban**|||||
|Number of cars owned|0|1|2|Lifestyle upgrade, convenience|
|Number of rooms in house|2|4|5|Income rise, real estate growth|
|Number of metalled roads|Very few|Moderate|Almost all|Government development|
|Number of flyovers|0|1|4|Traffic control, infrastructure planning|
|Number of parks/playgrounds|Many|Few|Very few|Land being used for buildings, malls|

# **Observation:**

> Open spaces, trees, and traditional occupations are reducing.
> 
> Urban areas are growing rapidly, while rural spaces are shrinking and changing.
> 
> There’s more tech, transport, and housing, but less nature and community interaction.

# **Sketch: Land Use Pattern (20 Years From Now)**

- Draw tall **apartment buildings**
- Add **flyovers**, **metro lines**, fewer **trees**, a small **park squeezed** between buildings
- Label things like “Smart Home Tower”, “Mini Mall”, “E-waste Recycling Unit”
- Bonus points if you add: **“Old Banyan Tree (surviving somehow)”**

**Why changes will happen:**

> Because of population growth, urban expansion, tech development, and demand for housing. Rural land is being used for industries and infrastructure.
