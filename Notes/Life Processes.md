- **The organism needs to break down outside sources of energy since it is not it its control**
- **The food has to be finally converted into a universal source of energy that can be used for the various molecular movements needed for maintaining living structures and the ones the body needs to grow**
- **This requires a sireis of chemical reactions are required. Oxidising/reducing (Redox) reactions are one of hte most common chemical means to break down molecules**
- **To do this, many organisms use oxygen aquired from outside the body**
