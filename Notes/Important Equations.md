## Displacement Reactions
Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen
$$Zn + H2SO_4 → ZnSO_4 + H_2$$
## White wash
Quick Lime (Calcium Oxide) + water = Slaked Lime
$$CaO(s)+H_2O(aq)=Ca(OH)_2(aq)+heat$$
Slaked Lime is used for white washing
#### How is turns white:
Slaked lime (Calcium hydroxide) + Carbon Dioxide = Calcium Carbonate + Water
$$Ca(OH)_2(aq)+CO_2=CaCO_3(s)+H_20(aq)$$
## Burning of coal
Coal is carbon
$$C+O_2=CO_2$$
