# How different organisms take in food:
## Fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms:
- **They break down food outside their body and then absorb it**
## Parasites:
- **They live in the host cell and take nutrition without killing them**

- **It takes in food using temporary finger like projections that fuse around the particle making a vacuole**
- **Inside the vacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones**
- **This is then absorbed by the cytoplasm**
- **The undigested material is then thrown out**

- **It has a definite shape and food is moved to a specific spot with the help of cilia that cover the entire surface of the cell**
