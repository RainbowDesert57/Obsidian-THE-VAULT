**<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mrs. Pumphrey: Oh dear, I pampered Tricki so much! I thought feeding him was love.**</span>

**<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mother Seagull: Love sometimes means letting go. I had to push my son off the ledge to teach him to fly.</span>**

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mrs. Pumphrey: That sounds harsh!</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mother Seagull: But necessary. He found his wings only because he faced fear.</span>**

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mrs. Pumphrey: Hmm... I relied too much on comforts. Maybe I feared his discomfort more than he did.</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mother Seagull: Strength grows in struggle. Trust them—they surprise you.</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Mrs. Pumphrey: Indeed. Next time, I’ll be brave too.</span>
