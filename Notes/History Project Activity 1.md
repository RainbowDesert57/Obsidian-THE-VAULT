## Diary entry

**March 12, 1930 — Sabarmati Ashram**

Dear Diary,

Today was no ordinary day. I walked beside **Gandhiji** himself as we began our 240-mile march to Dandi to protest the **British salt tax**. The early morning air was filled with determination and chants of _"Swaraj!"_. Every step felt heavy, but also full of purpose.

We are not armed. We carry no weapons. Yet we march with a cause greater than ourselves. _“Even a pinch of salt can shake the Empire”_, Bapu said — and I believe him.

My feet hurt, but my heart is on fire. I’m proud to be part of this non-violent revolution. Old and young, women and students — all are joining in.

I can feel history unfolding under my feet. This is not just about salt. This is about our **right to dignity**, our **freedom from injustice**, and our **dream of Swaraj**.

The British may have laws, but we have unity.

_Inquilab Zindabad!_
