## <span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold">The fight against injustice has been led by many great leaders. Among them are Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. Each stood for equality, freedom, and human dignity in their own country. Though they came from different parts of the world, their struggles were united by a common purpose — to end discrimination and bring freedom and lasting change through courage and determination.</span>

## <span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Compare and Contrast</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela each led historic movements against injustice, but their approaches were different. Gandhi believed in _ahimsa_ — non-violence — and used peaceful protests like the Non-Cooperation Movement to fight British rule in India.</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">His methods later inspired Martin Luther King Jr., who adopted similar strategies during the American Civil Rights Movement to challenge racial segregation.</span>

---

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Nelson Mandela’s path was more complex. While he initially supported armed resistance against apartheid in South Africa, years in prison led him to embrace peace and reconciliation.</span>

## <span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span>

<span style = "animation: fadeInUp 0.7s ease-in-out; font-weight: bold;">Though their struggles took place in different regions — India, the U.S., and South Africa — all three leaders stood for justice, equality, and human rights. Mandela, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. proved that the fight for justice transcends borders.</span>
